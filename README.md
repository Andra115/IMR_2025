Video Lab2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xjBVH8Taik

So for the second lab we did the setup like in the video and then we have these potions (couldn'd find darts or a good basketball hoop) that we can pick up with the controllers and throw at a bookshelf (just cause it kinda fit the theme) and upon impact a splash effect will play and the score will appear above the bookshelf. The score is calculated from the point in which the bottle was released to the point of impact.
